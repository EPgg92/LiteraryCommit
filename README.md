## Story of a CommitStory

RandomTextCommit is a humble initiative in progress to 'literalise' our commits. 

The original idea was to invade the commit system by Literature: to design literary commits. The content of a literary commit is retrieved -- more or less randomly -- from a text chosen by the user and focused on two terms within the text (words that the user may choose).

---

For the record, on a rainy Saturday of November, Enzo was feeling somewhat bored so he asked Mmellet what she needed in terms of tools. As part of the ongoing publication of her PhD thesis, Mmellet wanted to commit passages from *The Annotated Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde* by Robert Louis Stevenson depending on her moods. On good days, she wanted to commit in Jekyll style (one sentence including "Jekyll"); on bad days, she wanted to commit in Hyde style (one sentence including "Hyde"); and when the day itself is uncertain, she wanted to commit in Jekyll & Hyde style (one sentence including both protagonists). This is what Enzo did.

---

RTC rooted in the adversity of narratives and the antinomy of storys in Literature.

---

Who is more present between Hyde and Jekyll? Who takes over the text in this internal struggle within the narrative?  

---

RTC thus provides a short analysis of the terms' recurrences and, especially, of their associations in the sentence flow. RTC provides three possibilities of commitment, one for each term and one for their association.  

## Make Me Yours 

Currently, three corpora have been invested by RTC:

- *The Annotated Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde* by Robert Louis Stevenson on the [`jekyll_hyde` branch](https://github.com/EPgg92/RandomLiteraryExtract/tree/jekyll_hyde) for the terms "jekyll" and "hyde" 
- *The Mirror of the Sinful Soul* by Marguerite de Navarre on the [`marguerite_navarre` branch](https://github.com/EPgg92/RandomLiteraryExtract/tree/marguerite_navarre) for the terms "femme" and "dieu"
- *Romeo and Juliet* by William Shakespeare on the [`romeo_juliet` branch](https://github.com/EPgg92/RandomLiteraryExtract/tree/romeo_juliet) for the terms "romeo" and "juliet"

## Help Me Please

If you have problems, difficulties or fears with the setting up of RTC, you can : 

- refer to the usage examples: [RTC_Jekyll_Hyde](https://github.com/EPgg92/RandomLiteraryExtract/tree/jekyll_hyde), [RTC_Marguerite](https://github.com/EPgg92/RandomLiteraryExtract/tree/marguerite_navarre), [RTC_Romeo_Juliet](https://github.com/EPgg92/RandomLiteraryExtract/tree/romeo_juliet)
- create an issue on the [present repository](https://github.com/EPgg92/RandomTextCommit/issues)
- cry in front of the screen watching the rain on a Saturday in November (not recommanded).
